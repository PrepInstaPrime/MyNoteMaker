# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue: MIME Type Error
The error "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"" is caused by Netlify serving JavaScript files with the wrong MIME type.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Added proper MIME type headers for JavaScript files
- Set correct publish directory (`dist`)
- Added Node.js version specification

### 2. Updated `vite.config.js`
- Explicitly set build output directory
- Disabled sourcemaps for production
- Optimized build configuration

### 3. Fixed API Configuration
- Simplified environment detection
- Added debugging logs
- Removed function-based approach

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes**
2. **In Netlify dashboard:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18 (or latest LTS)

3. **Redeploy your site**

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting MIME type errors:
1. Clear Netlify cache
2. Force rebuild
3. Check if `netlify.toml` is in the root of your frontend folder

### If API calls fail:
1. Check browser console for API URL logs
2. Verify backend is accessible at `https://mynotemaker.onrender.com`
3. Test API endpoints directly

### If build fails:
1. Check Node.js version compatibility
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check for any import errors

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
- JavaScript files should load with correct MIME type
- API calls should work from Netlify domain
- React Router should work properly
- All functionality should work as expected
